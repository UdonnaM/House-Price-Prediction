# ML-Based House Price Prediction Web App

This project is a web application designed to predict house prices using machine learning. Built with Flask, the application leverages a linear regression model trained on real estate data to estimate house prices based on various features. The user interface allows users to input details about a house and receive a predicted price in return.
